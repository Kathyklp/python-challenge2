# python-challenge2
I tried to use VS Code with this assignment, but I was unable to get the file to read in and neither could the tutor - he indicated that I must have my files mixed up? I tried the way we did it in class and it did not work 
I tried the tutorial for VS Code online, but it did not work 
I read through the assignment and did not see where it said I had to use VSCode 
So, I switched to Jupyter

That did not go well either - I switched back to VS Code, but no one could tell me why I could not read in the code like we did in class  
I also tried to read in the csv files from several different ways they showed on the internet, but it did not work either. 

Reading in files is an ongoing problem but no one seems to know why ??

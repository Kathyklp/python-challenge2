# python-challenge2
I tried to use VS Code with this assignment but I was unable to get the file to read in and neither could the tutor - he indicated that I must have my files mixed up? I tried the way we did it in class and it did not work 
I tried the tutorial for VS Code online but it did not work 
I read through the assignment and did not see where it said I had to use VSCode 
So I switched to Jupyter
